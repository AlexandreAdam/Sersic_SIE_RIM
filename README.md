#TODOs

0. Train a CNN as a baseline to predict summary statistics.
1. Train a RIM (CNN head + Dense - GRU - Dense - GRE - Dense model) as a point estimator of the summary statistics
2. Use pydelfi to train an ensemble of Mixture Density Networks and flows to learn the likelihood of summary statistics and simulation params
3. Make a coverage plot
